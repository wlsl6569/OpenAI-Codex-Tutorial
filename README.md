## DAY 1

1. Open Visual Studio Code and the terminal.
2. In the terminal, navigate to the location where you want to clone the repository (in this tutorial, we use `C:\`).
3. Clone the example repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wlsl6569/OpenAI-Codex-Tutorial.git
```
4. Navigate into the project folder and verify that the files were cloned correctly:
```bash
cd OpenAI-Codex-Tutorial  # go into the project folder
dir                      # check that all files are included
git status               # verify the branch and working tree status
```

5. Ask Web Codex (OpenAI) for a simple code example.
